# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction - Data Analysis & Machine Learning Project

This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset and builds a predictive model to determine whether a passenger would have survived the tragedy based on various features like age, gender, class, and fare. It’s a complete end-to-end data science project using Python and popular libraries like pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset.
- Apply **data cleaning and preprocessing** techniques.
- Visualize trends and survival rates across different features.
- Build and evaluate **machine learning models** to predict survival.
- Demonstrate the end-to-end data science workflow.

## 🗃️ Dataset

The dataset used is the classic Titanic dataset available from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data).

- `train.csv`: Training data with labels (Survived column)
- `test.csv`: Test data without labels

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Gender-wise survival rate
- Class-wise survival probability
- Age distribution and survival trends
- Correlation heatmaps and feature relationships

Visualizations were created using:
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

- Handling missing values (Age, Embarked, Cabin)
- Encoding categorical variables (Sex, Embarked)
- Feature selection and engineering (e.g., combining SibSp & Parch)

---

## 🧠 Model Building

We tested and compared various machine learning models:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Model evaluation metrics:
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Cross-validation scores

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- pandas, numpy
- seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
